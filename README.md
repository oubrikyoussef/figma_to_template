# Figma To Template

This is a minimalist website that I have created using the core concepts of HTML and CSS (responsive design, grid, flex, etc.).
from a figma design as part of the openclassrooms course "Int√©grez une maquette Figma en HTML / CSS" mentored by Mr.Gabriel .

## Overview

## The Challenge

Converting Figma designs into responsive CSS and HTML templates comes with its own set of challenges. I've focused on addressing two key aspects:

### Optimal Layout for Different Devices


To address these challenges,I've leveraged the unlimited capabilities of Flexbox and CSS Grid, along with variable units (such as rem, percentages, vw, etc.) and CSS variables. This approach ensures that the generated templates offer an optimal layout regardless of the device's screen size."

### Preserving Design Dimensions

Respect the original dimensions and maintain the integrity of the creator's vision.

### Clear Code and File Structure

To address this challenge,I've made the template with a clear and structured codebase. I followed the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention to ensure consistency and readability in my stylesheets. Moreover, i emphasize a modular approach by creating a dedicated folder for recurrent components, promoting reusability and maintainability.
